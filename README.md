# mpris-rpc

mpris-rpc is a discord rich presence status that shows media being played by apps that support MPRIS.

# TODO List
- [x] Remove the "" and [] from showing up on song and artist names
- [x] Adding some sort of whitelisting functionality, to allow choosing which apps are tracked
- [x] Add an installer script to automatically compile and place the config in the right directory.
- [ ] add better error handeling in order to run it as background service
- [ ] disable whitelist if it's empty
- [ ] make a systemd service
- [ ] Showing song covers. Currently the image that is shown is the icon for the discord app you set

# Config
The config file mpris-rpc.kdl has to be placed in ~/.config/mpris-rpc. For now, the config has to be moved manually. ~~mpris-rpc **will not** work without the config file~~ mpris-rpc works now without the config file. if the config file cannot be read, it will use the app id of my discord app, and an update time of 10 seconds.

# Installation
**You need go installed on your system for mpris-rpc to work** 

you also need a discord aplication in order for it to appear as an activity inside of discord

Its possible to either run it as is, by running `go run mpris-rpc.go` while in the files directory, or build it by running `go build mpris-rpc.go` and then running the file from a terminal.
